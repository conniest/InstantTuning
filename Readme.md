**Title**: Instant Tuning for a Manual Tuner

**Authors**: Connie Stillinger W6EFI and Robert Melville WB3EFT

**Abstract**:

A random wire with a small manual tuner can be an effective antenna setup for portable operations.    Add a portable network analyzer or small VNA to your kit and tuning can be made more precise, but is still a matter of trial and error, albeit guided.   In this presentation we describe a method for going straight to the optimum tuner settings, giving a previously-gathered one-time characterization of the tuner and a one-time sweep of the antenna.  This method is an adaptation of Melville and Hamilton, "Silent Tuning: Matching a transmitter to an antenna
without emitting a signal"  (MILCOM 2021)
